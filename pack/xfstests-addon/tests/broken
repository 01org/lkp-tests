## The following these ext4 relevant testcases(ext4/006 ~ ext4/019) need to the newer e2fsprogs package(v1.43.xxx),
## currently we use the command "apt-get install e2fsprogs" can't upgrade to v1.43.xxx version,
## this is due to our apt-get repo is a bit old, so we filter these testcases temporarily.

## The following these btrfs relevant testcases will be filtered, since some cases still have a bug in latest version(such as btrfs/047),
## and the others are test function failure, to void generate the error info in 'lkp log', we also need to filter these testcases.
## In addition, "btrfs/101" need to the newer btrfs-tools packages,but our repo is a bit old, can't upgrade to the very new btrfs-tools version,
## so we also filter this sub item temporarily.

## The following these xfs relevant testcases will be filtered, and some cases(85~102,142~163) need to the newer e2fsprogs package and "DMAPI"
## user space tools, currently we use the command "apt-get install" can't install "DMAPI" package, so we filter these testcases temporarily.
## We try use "libdm0" and "libdm0-dev" package to instead of "DMAPI" package, but it still failed.

## The "generic" testcase will use the different filesystem to test which will generate the different running result.
## For example:
## generic/114 with ext4 filesystem can pass the function checking.
## generic/114 with xfs  filesystem can't pass the function checking.
##
## Due to "generic" testcase have the different result with the different filesystem, we just filter the subcase which can't pass any filesystem.
