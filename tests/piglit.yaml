 Piglit is a collection of automated tests for OpenGL implementations.

 The goal of Piglit is to help improve the quality of open source OpenGL
 drivers by providing developers with a simple means to perform regression
 tests.

 Current status is that the framework is working (though rough at the edges).
 It contains the Glean tests, some tests adapted from Mesa as well as some
 specific regression tests for certain bugs. HTML summaries can be generated,
 including the ability to compare different test runs.
