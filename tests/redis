## Redis is an open source (BSD licensed), in-memory data structure store,
## used as a database, cache and message broker. It supports data structures
## such as strings, hashes, lists, sets, sorted sets with range queries,
## bitmaps, hyperloglogs, geospatial indexes with radius queries and streams.
## Redis includes the redis-benchmark utility that simulates running commands
## done by N clients at the same time sending M total queries (it is similar
## to the Apache's ab utility)
