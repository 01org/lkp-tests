 pmbench - paging and virtual memory benchmark

description: >
 pmbench is a micro-benchmark that profiles system paging performance by
 measuring latencies of  each  memory  access  throughout  the  run  and
 reporting the statistics of measured latencies.

homepage: 

parameters:
 runtime: 
 mapsize: Specify virtual address map size in Mebibyte (2^20 bytes)  unit. The default is 256.
 setsize: Specify  working  set  size  in  Mebibyte unit.  It should be no greater than mapsize. The default is 128.
 pattern: [linear, uniform, normal, pareto]  
 shape: Pattern-specific  numeric parameter that determines the shape of the distribution.  See Usage for details.   
 jobs: Number of concurrent worker threads to spawn for the  benchmark. Some releases may not support this option. The default is 1.
 timestamp: [rdtsc, rdtscp, perfc]
 cold: [y, n]
 access: [histo, touch]
